Dear ,

I am writing this email to request an early release from my notice period, which is scheduled to end on June 16th, 2023. As you know, I resigned from my position on March 16th, 2023 due to health issues. During our intial discussion, you had mentioned the possibility of an early release from my notice period, and I understand that it was not a final confirmation.

As you know, I have been suffering from an eye infection, back pain, migraine, and headache, which have been exacerbated by the frequent changes in my shift timings, including working at night and during the afternoon. My doctor provided me with a medical certificate to confirm my condition.

I have already provided Knowledge transfer to the new hires and I am willing to work until May 15th, 2023, to ensure a smooth transition. However, I cannot work beyond that date due to a health issue.

I understand that my resignation has caused some inconvenience, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. I hope you'll be able to understand my situation and consider my request for early release from my notice period.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ayush Patel
